    Dear Vidhu,



 Happy birthday! This is  your 
 19th birthday, and 
 i dont know why 
 but i am so so so  happy.
 You have no idea 
 how much I pray for your 
 success and happiness.
 I genuinely want you to be the
 happiest person
 and achieve everything you desire.

 Happy birthday, little girl. 
 You are the one person 
 who came into my life
 and changed me a lot. 
 I really like the way you 
 live your life.
 In the end,
 thank you for everything, 
 as I always said...
                
    Stay healthy,
    Stay safe,
    Stay as you are,
    But keep growing.
                
    One of your friend.
